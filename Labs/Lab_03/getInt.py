# Task 4 â€“ Input an Integer Between Two Limits

# In this part you'll ask the user to input an#  integer between a minimum and maximum values.
# 	If the user fails to enter an acceptable#  value for three times then you stop asking!# 
# 1.	Add a new file: getInt.py and make it th# e startup file.# 
# 2.	Create two variables for the min and max#  values. # 
# Set two values for these variables such as 1#  and 100.# 
# 3.	Write a while loop that attempts to get # an intege# r from#  the user between the limits # of#  min and max values.
# 4.	If the user has tried three times and fa# ils then # print # None. # 
# If a valid value is entered, just end the lo# op and pr# int it# s valu# e.# 
# 
# Note: None is a valid keyword in Python whic# h stands # for Nu# ll.#
