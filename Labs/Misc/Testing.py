# testing

# We can potentially have lots of errors in our code - so we should test.
# Write tests is cheaper solution tan refactoring our code after deployment
# Types of tests:
    # unit tests - test each block of code/function in isolation.
    # integration testing - how does the code work in raltion to other code?
    # user-acceptance - by customer/staff - does teh app do what it's supposed to do?
    # QA testing - rules + regulations
    # non - functional testing (monitoring)
    # performance, scalability, useability, up time.
    # maintenance testing - we push a change to our code and see what happens.

# install pip
# install pytest

# fiel naming convention 
# test_example.py
# example_test.py pip(3) install pytes
